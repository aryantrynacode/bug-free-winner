# Scene describe for eye impairment can be used in glasses with cams 
Describes what is in front of the user
# objective
1. identify any obstacles or person in front early
for example : there are stairs infront
model output simple : Stairs
another example :user behind a person
model output : A person
can be complexified by facial recognition by app system
for example a known person who our model facially recognized
users brother used facial recognition by app now whenever he comes in front instead of model output being --> A person
model output comes : brother(name)
can be done for multiple faces

# need to do more research on tech available and how to tackle this project
