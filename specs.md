# subtitle software for hearing impairment can be used in glasses
similar to transcription but in real time

#features 
# 1. speech to text real time
# 2. safety alerts - alarms recognition , siren recognition

# 3. Simple method
microphone connected to glasses for better audio --> A  streaming speech recognition model(like whisper streaming,Deepspeech streaming or Google's RNN-T/Conformer) runs -->transcribe audio chunk by chunk.
first , it outputs a best guess --> may be irrelevent --> as more context arrives , the model updates the text 

example- first guess = I am --> model updates --> i am going  --> i am going home

# 4. Real-Time Subtitle Rendering

The partial results are immediately shown as subtitles (like “draft mode”).

When the model is more confident (end of phrase detected), the system locks in the final subtitle.

Example:

Live: I’m go…

Final: I’m going home.

# 5. Low Latency Optimizations

Chunk size → smaller chunks = faster but less accurate. Larger chunks = better accuracy but more delay.

Beam search limits → smaller search beam speeds up decoding.

On-device inference → faster than sending to cloud (but heavier on battery).

Hardware acceleration → TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, CoreML, etc.

# 6. Why It Works in Practice

Humans tolerate ~300–500 ms delay in subtitles (same as a bad Zoom connection).

ASR systems can process faster than real-time (e.g., Whisper tiny can transcribe 1 second of audio in ~50–200 ms on a phone).

So while someone is still speaking, the subtitles are already appearing.

Ephemeral, per-statement real-time subtitles (no storage) — plan + runnable example

Perfect — you want each utterance to be transcribed, shown to the user immediately, then disappear (never stored). Below is a compact plan + two runnable options you can pick: (A) quick console prototype or (B) WebSocket + browser HUD (recommended if you want an overlay/AR/phone UI). Both are ephemeral by design (no disk writes, no DB). I give the code, run instructions, and tuning tips.

How it works (summary)

Microphone → VAD segments speech into utterances (one statement).

Send each utterance to ASR → get final transcript for that utterance.

Run sentiment/emotion fusion.

Broadcast the single-line JSON {speaker, text, emotion, timestamp} to connected clients.

Clients render the line immediately and auto-remove it after N seconds (e.g., 4s). No server-side storage.

A. Quick console-only prototype (ephemeral)

If only need to see it working locally on laptop, use the earlier script but print and drop results. No storage.

What to change from previous script

after computing final_emotion and transcript, simply print() and return (don't write file, don't append to DB).

Optionally sleep for the display length if you want to simulate vanish (not necessary for console).

# Architecture & components

Audio front-end

Microphone (wearable / lapel / headset).

Preproc: resample to 16 kHz mono, noise suppression (optional), beamforming if mic-array available.

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) & endpointing

webrtcvad or a lightweight energy+VAD to cut audio into utterances (short segments representing one statement).

(Optional) Speaker diarization

pyannote.audio or lightweight clustering to label speakers if you need Speaker 1 / 2 / ….

ASR (per-utterance)

Low-latency ASR that you can run locally: whisper.cpp (ggml) or faster-whisper or Vosk depending on device and accuracy/latency needs.

For a fast prototype on a laptop, faster-whisper / Whisper small works well; for very lightweight Pi use vosk or whisper.cpp.

Text sentiment classifier

Hugging Face pipeline("sentiment-analysis") with a small transformer (or a distilled model) for speed.

Audio emotion classifier (optional but recommended)

pipeline("audio-classification", model=...) using a wav2vec2 or SpeechBrain emotion model to get tone-based emotion (anger, sadness, joy, neutral).

Fusion logic

Combine text sentiment + audio emotion into a final label (rules or a small meta-classifier).

Renderer

Console, web UI, WebSocket to phone/glasses, Android HUD, or AR overlay.
