# subtitle software for hearing impairment can be used in glasses
similar to transcription but in real time
---
#features 
1. speech to text real time
2. safety alerts - alarms recognition , siren recognition

Simple method
microphone connected to glasses for better audio --> A  streaming speech recognition model(like whisper streaming,Deepspeech streaming or Google's RNN-T/Conformer) runs -->transcribe audio chunk by chunk.
first , it outputs a best guess --> may be irrelevent --> as more context arrives , the model updates the text 

example- first guess = I am --> model updates --> i am going  --> i am going home

# 4. Real-Time Subtitle Rendering

The partial results are immediately shown as subtitles (like “draft mode”).

When the model is more confident (end of phrase detected), the system locks in the final subtitle.

Example:

Live: I’m go…

Final: I’m going home.

# 5. Low Latency Optimizations

Chunk size → smaller chunks = faster but less accurate. Larger chunks = better accuracy but more delay.

Beam search limits → smaller search beam speeds up decoding.

On-device inference → faster than sending to cloud (but heavier on battery).

Hardware acceleration → TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, CoreML, etc.

# 6. Why It Works in Practice

Humans tolerate ~300–500 ms delay in subtitles (same as a bad Zoom connection).

ASR systems can process faster than real-time (e.g., Whisper tiny can transcribe 1 second of audio in ~50–200 ms on a phone).

So while someone is still speaking, the subtitles are already appearing.
