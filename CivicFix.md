# 🚦 Project: CivicFix AI – Smart Complaint Filing Agent
# 🎯 Problem It Solves

Citizens face potholes, broken traffic lights, garbage piles, but reporting is time-consuming.*

Many official complaint portals exist, but they’re confusing and underutilized.

Most people don’t bother reporting, so issues stay unresolved.

This Agentic AI bridges the gap between citizens and government complaint portals.

# 🛠️ How It Works (Workflow)

User Uploads Evidence

Uploads an image/video (pothole, traffic light, trash, etc.).

Optionally adds a short text description.

AI Auto-Analyzes Complaint

Uses computer vision to classify: "pothole" / "trash" / "traffic light".

Extracts location (GPS metadata from image, or asks user).

Agentic Conversation

AI asks:

"Do you want me to create an official complaint on [XYZ portal]?"

User confirms.

AI collects necessary details (like complaint category, address, contact info).

Automated Issue Filing

AI logs into the official complaint site (via API or browser automation like Playwright/Selenium).

Submits the complaint with image + location + description.

Tracking & Feedback

AI saves complaint ID and sends updates (SMS/Email/WhatsApp).

User can later ask: "What’s the status of my pothole complaint?" → AI fetches update.

# 🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend

Streamlit / React.js → User uploads image + interacts with chatbot.

Backend

FastAPI / Flask → Handles AI logic + automation.

AI Components

LLM (GPT/LLaMA/Mistral) → For conversation + complaint drafting.

Computer Vision (YOLOv8, Detectron2, or CLIP) → Classifies type of civic issue from image.

OCR (Tesseract / EasyOCR) → Extracts text if signs/boards are in image (e.g., location board).

Automation

Selenium / Playwright → Automates filing on govt. complaint websites (if no API).

RPA tools (Robocorp / TagUI) → Alternative for form-filling automation.

Data & Storage

Postgres / Firebase → Store complaint history, complaint IDs.

ChromaDB / Pinecone → Store past issues + FAQ retrieval.

# ⚡ Unique Features (that make it truly “Agentic”)

Smart Category Detection → AI decides whether the issue is Road, Garbage, Traffic Light.

Auto-fill Forms → No manual typing on portals.

Multi-Channel → Works via WhatsApp bot / Web app / Mobile app.

Complaint Tracking Agent → Reminds user if govt. hasn’t resolved issue in X days.

# 🚀 Extensions (Future Scope)

Community Dashboard → Heatmap of potholes, garbage, and faulty signals.

Multi-Agent System:

Agent 1: Classifies issue.

Agent 2: Drafts complaint.

Agent 3: Files complaint + tracks updates.

Integration with Twitter/X → Auto-tweets tagged complaints to local authorities.

Reward Points → Encourage more citizens to report issues (like Swachh Bharat mission).

# 1-Month Roadmap for CivicFix AI
# ✅ Week 1: Foundations & Setup

Goal: Get the base structure, auth system, and database ready.

 Finalize tech stack (Streamlit/React frontend, FastAPI backend, Postgres or Firebase).

 Setup project repos (frontend + backend) and folder structure.

 Configure database schema (users, complaints, credits).

 Implement Login & Registration (Firebase Auth or FastAPI + JWT).

 Create a basic dashboard → show username + civic credits.

👉 Deliverable: Users can sign up/login and see their profile with 0 credits.

# ✅ Week 2: Complaint Filing Workflow

Goal: Enable uploading complaints + storing in DB.

 Create upload form (image/video + description).

 Integrate AI classification (YOLOv8 or placeholder model).

 Extract metadata (location/GPS or manual input).

 Build backend endpoint /file-complaint.

 Store complaint in DB (status = Filed).

👉 Deliverable: User can upload evidence → complaint stored in DB & linked to user.

# ✅ Week 3: Automation + Credits System

Goal: Complaints get filed officially + credits assigned.

 Implement automation layer (Selenium/Playwright stub for govt. site).

 Assign 100 Civic Credits automatically after filing.

 Update credits in DB + insert into credits_log.

 Dashboard shows complaints list + total credits.

👉 Deliverable: Filing a complaint adds 100 credits and updates dashboard.

# ✅ Week 4: Tracking, UI Polish & Testing

Goal: End-to-end MVP ready.

 Add tracking feature → store official complaint ID & status.

 Implement /get-status endpoint (mock or scrape status).

 Add leaderboard page (top citizens by credits).

 UI polish → badges, credit counter, status updates.

 End-to-end testing + bug fixes.

 Deploy (Streamlit Cloud + Render/Heroku for backend, or Firebase Hosting).

👉 Deliverable: MVP Launch – A citizen logs in, files a complaint, earns credits, and sees updates.
